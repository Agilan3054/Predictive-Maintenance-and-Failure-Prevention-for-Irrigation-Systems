# Predictive Maintenance and Failure Prevention for Irrigation Systems

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance and failure prevention system for irrigation systems, focusing on forecasting soil moisture levels and detecting anomalies. The system uses time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, and machine learning techniques to predict potential failures in irrigation systems, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.

## Key Features
- **Soil Moisture Forecasting**: Uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to forecast soil moisture levels and predict potential irrigation system failures.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implements Autoencoders to identify irregularities in sensor data that could indicate system malfunctions.
- **Seasonal Trend Analysis**: Utilizes ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models to account for seasonal trends in the data.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
- **Model Explainability**: Uses SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to provide interpretable insights into the factors influencing the failure predictions.
